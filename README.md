# Tugas4_PWEB_ParralaxTour
this branch is for task 4 of my PWEB Class, in this task i need to make a working calculator using javascript
the logic behind this calculator, is everytime a button is pressed, we add the value as string, then after the '=' was pressed, we use the javascript function eval() to evaluate the operation, but we need to replace % by /100.

also this calculator keep track of the previous operation. just as shown in the picture below
