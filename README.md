# Tugas2_PWEB_ParralaxTour
This repository is for my PWEB Class, this week i'll learn how to use basic html, css, and some JS to implement a parralax effect for my website

in this branch i learned how to make css animation, in this login page i mostly use TranslateX to make this animation, because basically this 
animation is just sliding a div from right to left.
